# Introduction

Web3 (or Crypto, or Bitcoin, or NFT, or whatever name you know it by) is a pretty complicated subject. It covers a broad range of topics and is changing constantly.&#x20;

This site is a an attempt by me (Dan Kantor) to understand as much as I can about it. I find that I only truly understand a technical subject by either writing about it or coding.

I'm making this writing public in the case that someone else out there can benefit from it. Some of these topics will be beginner level, some will be more advanced.&#x20;

All of this is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/dankantor/web3) so if you'd like to add or edit anything please send me a pull request. If you'd like to reach out otherwise, you can [contact me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dankantor).&#x20;

With that said, let's dive right in at the beginning - [what is a database?](<README (1).md>)
