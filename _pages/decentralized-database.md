# Decentralized Databases

In our last article we looked at the basic idea behind databases. Continuing our Twitter example, let's explore why Twitter's centralized database may have some downsides and then see how a decentralized database may offer some fixes to these issues. 

## Potential downsides of a centralized database

### Control access / ban users

Twitter has lots of data which they store in their centralized database. This includes tweets, users, and more. Since Twitter controls their own database, they get to decide who can read from it and who can write to it. This is true for all companies that control their own database (Facebook, Google, etc). 

Let's say Twitter decides that they do not want someone writing to their database. Since they are in control, they can ban anyone they please. This is not a hypothetical concept. In January 2021, Twitter banned the President of the United States from using their service. We can all agree or disagree about the merits of this ban. But what we cannot disagree on is that it happened. When a company controls a centralized database, they can decide who can and cannot access it. 

### Government censorship

The Internet may be global but it still runs on physical computers, wires and airwaves that exist inside sovereign entitites. These countries can make rules that govern how services such as Twitter act as well as how their citizens interact with such services. Since Twitter is a company that controls a centralized database, it is relatively easy for a government to block access to it. This is what has happened in China. Twitter is officially blocked there. If someone tries to open the Twitter app inside of China, it will not work. 

### Downtime

Running a centralized database that millions of people use is not easy. In the early days of Twitter it often went down.

### Hacking

A centralized database is a prime target for hackers.
